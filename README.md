# Business Problem and understanding

Microsoft sees all the big companies creating original video content and they want to create a new movie studio and achieve by exploring what types of films are currently doing the best at the box office.

To assist on this,i will consider;

Top ten most produced genres over the recording period
Success rate in terms of return on investments on the genres,domestic and foreign region performance for marketing and resource allocation purposes and audience rating to gauge market behaviour.
Studios involved in the most successful genres for the purpose of market interaction and undestanding. possible bench marking in regards to successful production and marketing structures,production budget maximisation,star power,seasonal trends and proper competition understanding.
# DATA
At my disposal,i have been provided for data sorces to analyse movie data.The likes of https://www.imdb.com/,https://www.rottentomatoes.com/ ,https://www.themoviedb.org/, https://www.the-numbers.com/ and https://www.boxofficemojo.com/ to create actionable insight that Microsoft can use to start a film studio.

The data for this analysis have come from Databases:

IMDb (movie title, release year, genres, and audience rating)
The Movie Database (movie title,popularity, audience rating)
Box Office Mojo (movie title, gross earnings,Studios)
The Number (release dates,gross earnings,production budget)essful genres for the purpose of market interaction and undestanding. possible bench marking in regards to successful production and marketing structures,production budget maximisation,star power,seasonal trends and proper competition understanding.
# DATA EXPLORATION AND VISUALIZATION
To begin,let us see the genres that has the highest rate of production over the period that the data was recorded.We will focus on the top 10 as an overview of the top productions. The distribution difference could hint a couple of things regarding the market behavior towards these genres hence the consistency in production by the studios.

Afterwards, we will test the sustainability of the top produced genres by profitablity (Return on investment) and average rating (consumer behavior and preference).

This is to conclude on recommending to Microsoft in regards to immediate and sustained gross returns of their new anticipated investment.
# CONCLUSION
Overall, the correlation heatmap provides insights into the interconnectedness between profitability, popularity, and average rating within the top 10 profitable genres. It suggests that successful genres tend to not only generate higher profits but also attract greater audience interest and appreciation, contributing to their overall success and positive reception.

Drama movies have demonstrated consistent success over the years in amassing the most amount of gross earnings and top production in numbers.

An interesting observation, genre class Adventure.Animation.Comedy as a subsiquent in earnings dispite the genre class having a relatively smaller suturation in production, closely followed by genre class Action.Adventure.Sci-Fi.

A seemingly direct propotionality between worldwide gross and production budget.
# RECOMMENDATIONS AND FUTURE CONSIDERATIONS
Fo both short and long term sustained gross earnings over time,Microsoft should produce Dramamovies,Adventure.Animation.Comedy movies and Action.Adventure.Sci-Fi movies

Considering the availability of a bigger foreign market compared to domestic market,Microsoft should consider anerlysing the demographics of movie-makers and movie-watchers and diversifying their production in regards to Culture,Race,Language,Religion,Heritage and any other factor that makes our society unique.This can be a Market to conqure

Getting more details on and interacting with the studios involved with top performing Movies/Genres will aid Microsoft in several factors like understanding and engaging in healthy competition and the market in general,bench marking,making better decisions like wether to actualize production internally,outsourcing or by collaborating.

Further analysis of more recent Data, and keeping up to date on the same will help Microsoft incorporate the changes in viewing practices, a factor that is part of the backbone of this business.
